    <h1>Welcome our Technology Development Club!</h1>
    <p>We are a club dedicated to developing prototype technologies to enrich our community. Completely student run, with support from LBCC Falculty, we have one driving goal:</p>
    <h3>Improve the community through advanced technology</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Weekly meetings take place to make progress towards this goal, and most of our members work on their own time to improve the designs.</p>
