    <h1>Welcome to LBCC Technology Development Club!</h1>
    <p>We are a club dedicated to developing prototype technologies to enrich our community. Completely student run, with support from LBCC Falculty, we have one driving goal:</p>
    <h3>Improve the community through advanced technology</h3>
    <p>Weekly meetings take place to make progress towards this goal, and most of our members work on their own time to improve the designs, and to tend to the adminstrative needs of the club.</p>
